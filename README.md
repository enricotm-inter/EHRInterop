## Running the `Docker` container
To start the IRIS instance, simply run `docker compose up --build` in the terminal
> *After running **docker compose up --build**, there is no need for any further configuration. This section will walkthrough some of the steps for the initialization, but it may be skipped to [Opening the Management Portal](#opening-the-management-portal)*

Also, it is possible to check in the logs if all the classes compiled succesfully and if the queries were executed

## Opening the Management Portal

First, make sure the instance finished starting and setting up before continuing

If the IRIS instance finished starting up, it is possible to access the instance **Management Portal** with the url *http://localhost:52775/csp/healthshare/ehrinterop/EnsPortal.ProductionConfig.zen* that will open directly into the **Production**

When prompted, use username `ehrinterop_client` and password `1010` to login

### If everything worked, the IRIS instance should open the Production and should be ready for testing the EHR Interop Induction Kit!
